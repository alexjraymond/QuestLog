# Components I'll need

navbar
individual task
create task modal
tasks list
footer

# overall logic

auth/demo login
put both the todo task name and description into openai api call in generate.ts
split returned string @ 'quest name' & 'quest description'
todo list to quest is optional
let users switch between quests or their prompt text for whole list

# ideas

import and render navbar/footer in \_app.tsx
